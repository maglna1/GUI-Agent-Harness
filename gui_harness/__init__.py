"""
gui_harness — GUI automation powered by Agentic Programming.

Primary entry point: gui_agent() in main.py
Architecture: Phase 0-5 loop (see DESIGN_unified_actions.md)

Lazy top-level exports (PEP 562): importing ``gui_harness`` itself pulls
NO heavy/native deps. ``gui_agent``'s *definition* only needs openprogram
+ a constants module — its heavy imports (opencv / ultralytics / the OS
desktop backends) live inside the function body, imported at call time.
So ``from gui_harness.main import gui_agent`` works without cv2 installed
and registers the function; cv2 et al. are only required to actually RUN
it. The other exports (execute_task / locate_target) DO pull the heavy
perception stack, so they're loaded lazily here — touching them without
the deps raises the underlying ImportError at access time, not at
``import gui_harness`` time. This keeps OpenProgram's harness discovery
(which imports ``gui_harness.agentics``) from exploding on a machine
that hasn't installed this harness's deps yet (``openprogram programs
install gui`` clones it and pip-installs its declared deps).
