## Error Details

| # | Primary failure | Secondary symptoms | Evaluator result | Log |

| 3 | About Profiles tab was not opened | Heavy HuggingFace setup retries; repeated `verify_step()` / `plan_next_action()` model errors after opening Troubleshooting Information | Evaluator did not find `page-tab[name="About Profiles"]`; score 0.0 | `task_3.log` |

## Error Categories

| Category | Affected tasks | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Opaque model/session failure | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14 | `RuntimeError: Agent session failed` | Triggered immediate execution collapse on tasks 1-2 and slowed later tasks; some tasks recovered before final scoring. |
| Screenshot/read cascade | 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 | `WARNING Image Read Error /tmp/gui_agent_screen.png`; `ValueError: need at least one array to stack` | Started after model/GUI failure or bad window focus. |
| Invalid image passed to model | 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 | OpenAI HTTP 400: image data is not a valid image | Appeared during conclusion after screenshot read failures. |
| GUI target drift / wrong window focus | 7 | Star-click targets landed outside Thunderbird and focused GIMP | Caused task 7 to lose the active app before the screenshot cascade. |
| Output missing | 4 | Evaluator could not find `/home/user/emails.bak` | Export/backup flow did not complete. |
| Incomplete app configuration | 6 | Evaluator found only a minimal `msgFilterRules.dat` | Local folder was created but message filter rules were not completed. |
| Runner success after early failures | 5, 8, 9, 11 | Official evaluator returned 1.0 despite early model/session errors | Shows early `Agent session failed` is not always fatal when later steps recover. |
| Runner success but evaluator fail | 12 | Runner printed `Task 12: SUCCESS`, official score was 0.0 | Record official evaluator score as benchmark truth. |
| Advanced preference mis-edit | 12 | `mail.quoteasblock` row value text became `ErU9` before final toggle | Config Editor interaction did not produce expected setting. |
| Evaluator setup failure | 1 | Upload failed with status 500: read-only filesystem at `/home/user/Desktop/firefox_decrypt.py` | Separate from runner failure; official score is N/A. |
| Infeasible / evaluator N/A | 14 | Evaluator printed `infeasible (task cannot be scored automatically)` | Official score is N/A. |
| HuggingFace asset download instability | 1, 3, 7, 11 | SSL EOF retries while downloading task assets | Downloads recovered after retries/curl fallback where applicable. |
| Missing proxy config warning | 1-14 | `evaluation_examples/settings/proxy/dataimpulse.json` not found | Non-blocking so far. |

## Handoff Notes

- Continue at Thunderbird task 15 in `runs/thunderbird_all_20260518_0442`.
- Official `test_all.json` lists 15 Thunderbird tasks; the older `benchmarks/osworld/thunderbird.md` says 24 and is stale.
- Treat official evaluator score as benchmark truth. Task 1 has no score because evaluator setup failed after runner failure.
- Watch for VM filesystem state. Task 1 evaluator could not upload to `/home/user/Desktop/firefox_decrypt.py` due to a read-only filesystem.
