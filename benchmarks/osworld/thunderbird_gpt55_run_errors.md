## Error Details

| # | Primary failure | Secondary symptoms | Evaluator result | Log |
|---|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----|
| 1 | `plan_next_action()` returned `Agent session failed` on step 1 | Screenshot read cascade on steps 2-15; conclusion got HTTP 400 invalid image | Evaluator setup failed: upload to `/home/user/Desktop/firefox_decrypt.py` returned read-only filesystem; score N/A | `task_1.log` |
| 2 | `plan_next_action()` returned `Agent session failed` on step 1 | Screenshot read cascade on steps 2-15; conclusion had one `Agent session failed` and one HTTP 400 invalid image | Evaluator checked accessibility tree and did not find `anonym-x2024@outlook.com`; score 0.0 | `task_2.log` |
| 3 | About Profiles tab was not opened | Heavy HuggingFace setup retries; repeated `verify_step()` / `plan_next_action()` model errors after opening Troubleshooting Information | Evaluator did not find `page-tab[name="About Profiles"]`; score 0.0 | `task_3.log` |
| 4 | Expected backup directory was missing | One verifier model error; screenshot read cascade on steps 12-15; conclusion got HTTP 400 invalid image | `ls -R /home/user/emails.bak` failed; score 0.0 | `task_4.log` |

## Error Categories

| Category | Affected tasks | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Opaque model/session failure | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | `RuntimeError: Agent session failed` | Triggered immediate execution collapse on tasks 1-2 and slowed later tasks; tasks 5-6 partially recovered before final scoring. |
| Screenshot/read cascade | 1, 2, 4 | `WARNING Image Read Error /tmp/gui_agent_screen.png`; `ValueError: need at least one array to stack` | Started after model/GUI failure. |
| Invalid image passed to model | 1, 2, 4 | OpenAI HTTP 400: image data is not a valid image | Appeared during conclusion after screenshot read failures. |
| Output missing | 4 | Evaluator could not find `/home/user/emails.bak` | Export/backup flow did not complete. |
| Incomplete app configuration | 6 | Evaluator found only a minimal `msgFilterRules.dat` | Local folder was created but message filter rules were not completed. |
| Evaluator setup failure | 1 | Upload failed with status 500: read-only filesystem at `/home/user/Desktop/firefox_decrypt.py` | Separate from runner failure; official score is N/A. |
| HuggingFace asset download instability | 1, 3 | SSL EOF retries while downloading task assets | Task 1 download recovered but upload failed; task 3 setup recovered after curl fallback. |
| Missing proxy config warning | 1-6 | `evaluation_examples/settings/proxy/dataimpulse.json` not found | Non-blocking so far. |

## Handoff Notes

- Continue at Thunderbird task 7 in `runs/thunderbird_all_20260518_0442`.
- Official `test_all.json` lists 15 Thunderbird tasks; the older `benchmarks/osworld/thunderbird.md` says 24 and is stale.
- Treat official evaluator score as benchmark truth. Task 1 has no score because evaluator setup failed after runner failure.
- Watch for VM filesystem state. Task 1 evaluator could not upload to `/home/user/Desktop/firefox_decrypt.py` due to a read-only filesystem.
