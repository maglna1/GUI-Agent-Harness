## Error Details

| # | Primary failure | Secondary symptoms | Evaluator result | Log |
|---|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----|
| 1 | Multiple `plan_next_action()` / `verify_step()` model errors | Recovered by known component match and double-clicked desktop video | PASS; VLC status playing | `task_1.log` |
| 2 | No blocking error observed | Missing proxy config warning only | PASS; `vlcrc` recording path verified | `task_2.log` |
| 3 | Failed to select the MP3 conversion profile and start export | Repeated clicks on/near profile field; no output file created | Missing `/home/user/Desktop/Baby Justin Bieber.mp3`; score 0.0 | `task_3.log` |
| 4 | `find_target_in_known()` returned `Agent session failed` once | First URL open attempt showed an error dialog, then retry succeeded | PASS; VLC status playing and URL filename matched | `task_4.log` |
| 5 | Snapshot was created, renamed, and moved, but content did not fully match reference | Four early `verify_step()` model errors; exhausted 15 steps | Partial score 0.876; file saved as `cache/eval_fba2c100/interstellar.png` | `task_5.log` |
| 6 | Evaluator hang after retrieving wallpaper | Screenshot read cascade on steps 9-15; conclusion got HTTP 400 invalid image | No official score printed; terminated hung evaluator/run | `task_6.log` |
| 7 | `plan_next_action()` returned `Agent session failed` on step 1 | Recovered by clicking known fullscreen toggle | PASS; screen/window sizes matched fullscreen | `task_7.log` |
| 8 | Expected output video was missing | Runner used a terminal/ffmpeg route and ended with runner SUCCESS | Missing `/home/user/1984_Apple_Macintosh_Commercial.mp4`; score 0.0 | `task_8.log` |
| 9 | Hotkey change did not match evaluator expectation | HuggingFace SSL retries during setup; repeated `verify_step()` model errors on steps 9-13 | `vlcrc` downloaded and checked; score 0.0 | `task_9.log` |
| 10 | Preference change did not match evaluator expectation | `plan_next_action()` model errors; screenshot read cascade on steps 5-15; conclusion got HTTP 400 invalid image | `vlcrc` downloaded and checked; score 0.0 | `task_10.log` |
| 11 | Advanced Qt volume color edit did not match evaluator expectation | Runner typed `0;0;0` into the volume slider color field and ended SUCCESS | `vlcrc` downloaded and checked; score 0.0 | `task_11.log` |
| 12 | Early `verify_step()` model errors | Recovered through Preferences and View > Minimal Interface flow | PASS; `vlcrc` downloaded and checked | `task_12.log` |
| 13 | Early `verify_step()` model errors | Recovered by enabling “Pause on the last frame of a video” and saving | PASS; `vlcrc` downloaded and checked | `task_13.log` |
| 14 | No blocking error observed | Standard Preferences flow | PASS; `vlcrc` downloaded and checked | `task_14.log` |

## Error Categories

| Category | Affected tasks | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Opaque model/session failure | 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 | `RuntimeError: Agent session failed` | Not always fatal; tasks 6 and 10 cascaded into unreadable screenshots. |
| Output missing | 3, 8 | Evaluator could not retrieve expected output file | Task 3 missed MP3 export; task 8 missed expected MP4 path. |
| Partial content mismatch | 5 | Evaluator scored saved snapshot at 0.876 | File placement/name were correct, but image match was imperfect. |
| Evaluator hang | 6 | Evaluator printed `Got wallpaper successfully` and then stopped producing output for >7 min | Terminated to avoid blocking the continuous run. |
| Invalid image passed to model | 6, 10 | OpenAI HTTP 400: image data is not a valid image | Appeared during conclusion after screenshot read failures. |
| Screenshot/read cascade | 6, 10 | `WARNING Image Read Error /tmp/gui_agent_screen.png`; `ValueError: need at least one array to stack` | Repeated after GUI navigation failures. |
| Runner success but evaluator fail | 8, 11 | Runner prints SUCCESS while official evaluator returns 0.0 | Treat evaluator as source of truth. |
| Profile/dropdown interaction failure | 3 | Repeated attempts to click the VLC Convert profile field | Likely needs stronger VLC-specific memory or direct profile-selection strategy. |
| Preference mismatch | 9, 10, 11, 15 | `vlcrc` evaluator returned score 0.0 after preference edit flows | The visible flow changed something or got stuck, but not the exact expected settings. |
| Infeasible / unscorable tasks | 16 | Evaluator returns N/A / infeasible | Exclude from official scored pass rate unless manually scored. |
| HuggingFace asset download instability | 9 | SSL EOF retries during setup | Setup recovered. |
| Missing proxy config warning | 1-16 | `evaluation_examples/settings/proxy/dataimpulse.json` not found | Non-blocking for current VLC tasks. |

## Handoff Notes

- Continue at VLC task 17 in `runs/vlc_all_20260518_0310`.
- Treat official evaluator score as benchmark truth. Task 3 conclusion sounded partially successful, but official score is 0.0 because the MP3 file was missing.
- Task 8 also printed runner SUCCESS, but official score is 0.0 because the expected MP4 file was missing.
- Task 11 printed runner SUCCESS, but official score is 0.0 because the expected `vlcrc` setting was not present.
- Task 5 is not a pass despite correct filename/location because the official score is 0.876.
- Task 6 has no numeric score because the evaluator hung after retrieving wallpaper; keep it separate from numeric fail until rerun or evaluator diagnosis.
- VLC task count in official `test_all.json` is 17; the older `benchmarks/osworld/vlc.md` says 15 and should not be used as the task count for this GPT-5.5 run.
